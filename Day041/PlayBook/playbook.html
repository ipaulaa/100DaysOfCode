<h1>Tags:</h1>
<h4>There are multiple tags in HTML, some of them like the headings need an opening and closing tag.</h4>
<h4>Others like the horizontal line(hr), break line (br), don't. Because of this they are called self-closing tags.</h4>
<h4>Another tag that was mentioned was the center (center) tag that centers the text written inside this open-close tag. This tag is obsolete.</h4>

<h1>Attributes:</h1>
<h4>We also saw that a tag can have attributes, those are written after the name inside the '<>'</h4>
