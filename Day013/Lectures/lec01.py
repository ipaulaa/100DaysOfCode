# Describe Problem:
# The problem is that the function won't do anything
# since 'i' will never have a value of 20 in the loop.

# def my_function():
#   for i in range(1, 20):
#     if i == 20:
#       print("You got it")
# my_function()

def my_function():
    for i in range(1, 21):
        if i == 20:
            print("You got it")
